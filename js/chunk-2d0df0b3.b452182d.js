But this didn't stop me as I always had someone to guide me further whenever I got stuck. Many times I found myself tinkering with other plugins that were written to understand parts of the Eclipse Plugin Development cycle what waere written theoretically in the Eclipse API documentation. This provided me a hands-on experience with Java development and Object Oriented Programming principles. Thus, I got to touch upon a few Eclipse plugins, improve upon one, and provide design choices for another.

This is also the same document that a customer gets when they buy one such product. This helps the company to mimic the experience that a new customer goes through when setting up our product for their development purpose. Here, I fixed the Getting Started Guide by providing contextual information which a new user wouldn't intuitively have about the system and the SDK we provide. This pulled me into a journey of Documentation, involving more customer facing documents, and code comments. I was introduced to Doxygen which is a de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated sources, with a very familiar Javadocs like syntax. "),o("br"),e._v(" I was curious to learn more about the low level code we write, and there couldn't have been a better way than to work on sample codes. We provide customers with SDK which also include sample codes that showcase the functionalities of our system while mimicing a potential use case, for e.g. two devices communicating using Bluetooth protocol. Thus testing, debugging and tinkering with them introduced me to several communication protocols like UART, SPI, and I2C which I also got to analyze through a logic analyzer. I also had an introduction to BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) protocols and samples when testing their samples manually and reporting defects using Xray.
