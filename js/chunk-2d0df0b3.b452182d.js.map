This helps the company to mimic the experience that a new customer goes through when setting up our product for their development purpose. Here, I fixed the Getting Started Guide by providing contextual information which a new user wouldn't intuitively have about the system and the SDK we provide.

Thus testing, debugging and tinkering with them introduced me to several communication protocols like UART, SPI, and I2C which I also got to analyze through a logic analyzer.
